# A-Comprehensive-Study-of-Artificial-Neural-Networks
Breast Cancer Detection using CNN-Have done extensive research using CNN, ANN and AI to detect and analyse breast cancer and developed a model for detection.
Objective- Creating a breast cancer classification model using an IDC
dataset. To accurately detect an image from the histology (study of the
microscopic structure of cells and tissues) - as benign or malignant.
• A CNN, convolutional neural networks, are used mainly for accurate face
detection. Even if the provided image is not of a good resolution, this
network does its work. Making work of a different kind of MLPs, these
have several layers which have the ability to get interconnected fully.
Primarily used to decipher a particular part of a given input, their
purpose solely is to give accurate output.
• What is Deep Learning- An initiative of Machine Learning,
this term is an approach towards the working of the human
mind and its neural networks(biological). Deep neural
networks, convolutional neural networks, etc are architectures
which are consisting multiple layers, through which the data
has to pass through, so that it can give us an output. It serves
for the better performance of AI and make its few applications
a possibility. Applied to many fields like computer vision and
speech recognition, deep learning is an intensive approach.
• What is Keras -An open-source library of the artificial neural
networks, which is written in Python. An API of a high-level.
It can run much better than others like TensorFlow. Its main
application is to make the experimentation run fast and
prototyping as it runs without any halt on the GPU and the
CPU. It is user-friendly. And it is extensible.
• In this project, we use python, to build a classification model,
which will get trained on about 80% histology images from the
dataset for breast cancer. The other 10% data will be kept for
validation. We will use a convolutional neural network defined by
an open-source library called Keras, and we will name it as
CancerNet. This network will get trained on the images from the
dataset. Then we will analyse the data with the help of a
confusion matrix so that we can check the working of our model.
IDC which is known as Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, as studied in
the types of breast cancer earlier, which gets formed in the milk
duct and spreads to the tissues outside of the milk duct, accounts
for about 80% of all the breast cancer cases, it is the most common
form of it.
• The IDC dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. The packagesmatplotlib, imultis, numpy, are downloaded in Python.
